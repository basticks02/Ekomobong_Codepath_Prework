## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Spotify**

Personalized Playlists (e.g., Discover Weekly)
Easy Cross-Device Syncing (pick up where you left off on any device)

**Notion**

Flexible Workspace Organization (boards, lists, pages)
Real-Time Collaboration (see others’ updates instantly)

**Slack**

Threaded Conversations (helps keep discussions focused)
Extensive Integrations (connects with other tools like Google Drive, Trello, etc.)

**Instagram**

Simple Image Editing & Filters
Stories Feature (quick, short-form content sharing)

**Google Maps**

Real-Time Traffic Updates (keeps you informed on delays)
Multiple Route Options (helps find the fastest or most scenic route)


*App Idea*

**JetFlux**
It’s designed to suggest flights and destinations for users based on their airline preferences, rewards programs, and personal travel habits. The app would analyze your past trips—looking at factors like preferred departure times, airline loyalty points, budget range, and travel purpose—to dynamically tailor flight and destination recommendations. It would also integrate with various airline booking systems to show you personalized fare options, real-time price alerts, and seat selections that reflect your preferences (e.g., aisle vs. window). Over time, FlightBuddy learns your favorite layover airports, in-flight amenities, and mileage-earning goals, making each trip planning process smoother and more optimized.



## Notes

I beleive my biggest challenge was getting aquainted witht the source controls on the Xcode environment.
